Web Development is a way to develop websites or applications for all the users who are connected by the internet.

Now let's look at what Web is, what web actually is -

When we say "web" all it is just the internet (I know very basic, right!).
So, first we must understand what Internet is. 
Internet is a collection of computers, servers, routers which are connected to each other with wires or wirelessly (mostly wirelessly now-a-days). Only function of the internet is to transmit data between all the connected devices. As all of the computer data is binary, the data that is transmitted by the internet is also binary. 
Now, if we want to transfer data we do need to some sort of information as to where the data is going. If we consider you and me & we are standing in front of each other and having a conversation that means I'm transmitting some data to you and you are transmitting some data to me. Now, here the important words are "you" and "me". If I am talking to someone who is not even not even there, then what will I be called "A mental person" right. So we are conversing - that is transmission of data but if I'm talking to you in English and you're talking to me in Japanese (which I don't understand) can we say that transmission of data happened? No. Cause I simply did not understand what you were trying to tell me.

So, we set a rule between us that whenever we talk we will only talk only in "English" or a language we both understand. And it is the same with computers and Web.

In computer sciency terms we call these rules as protocols (I know seems to formal and complicated). Protocols are just a standard way / rules decided by consensus for the transmission of data on the Internet.

We will look at what those rules are, and move forward in upcoming posts. Stay Tunes!!!
